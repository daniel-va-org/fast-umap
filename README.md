## TODO

- [ ] add better chart
- [ ] add MNIST example (do a grid chart with different hyper parameters)
- [ ] add benchamrks
- [ ] find correlation between number of features and number of epochs via loss
- [ ] stop epoch training if loss doesn't go lower, or low enough
- [ ] add another method to fit/transform data (syntax sugar wrapper)
